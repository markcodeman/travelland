## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 503 Service Unavailable
**Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes. Render takes time to build and start the app.

### Issue: No Google Places data showing
**Solutions**:
1. Verify `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is set in Environment variables
2. Check that Google Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Verify API key restrictions aren't blocking requests
4. Check Render logs for errors: Dashboard → Logs

### Issue: Port binding error
**Solution**: Ensure `app.py` uses:
```python
port = int(os.getenv('PORT', 5010))
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False)
```

### Issue: Build fails
**Solutions**:
1. Verify `requirements.txt` exists in `city-guides/` directory
2. Check that all packages are spelled correctly
3. View build logs for specific error messages
