# AGENTS.md Enforcement - Always Active Context

MANDATORY: AGENTS.md must be included in active context for every chat session.

## Protocol for Every Response

1. **READ AGENTS.md first** - Before any code changes or suggestions
2. **IDENTIFY conflicts** - Check if request violates AGENTS.md directives  
3. **VERIFY compliance** - Ensure approach follows all AGENTS.md rules
4. **FLAG violations** - Stop and report conflicts immediately

## Critical AGENTS.md Rules (Never Violate)

- **NO HARDCODING**: No static dictionaries, city lists, mappings, profiles
- **DYNAMIC OVER STATIC**: Use APIs (Wikipedia, DDGS, OSM) instead of hardcoded data
- **REJECT MEDIOCRITY**: "Working" isn't good enough
- **USER-CENTRIC RAGE**: What would piss off real users?

## Conflict Resolution

If request conflicts with AGENTS.md:
1. STOP immediately
2. Say: "CONFLICT with AGENTS.md: [specific rule violated]"
3. Propose AGENTS.md-compliant alternative
4. Do not proceed with violating approach

## Auto-Verification

Before every code edit, verify:
- Am I adding static data? (dictionaries, lists, mappings)
- Can this be fetched from an API instead?
- If YES to both → REJECT and use dynamic approach
