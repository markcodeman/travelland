# PC Upgrade Recommendation for TravelLand Development Workflow

## Current System:
- **CPU**: Intel Core i5-12400 (12th Gen, 6C/12T)
- **RAM**: 8 GB (6 GB used, 2 GB available)
- **Storage**: Likely SSD based on typical modern setups
- **Workflow**: 
  - Frontend development (React, Vite)
  - Backend development (Python/Quart)
  - API integration (Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, others)
  - AI work (heavy AI work but on provider cloud)
  - Testing (Playwright, unit tests)

## Upgrade Recommendations:

### 1. RAM (Highest Priority)
- **Current**: 8 GB
- **Recommendation**: 16-32 GB (32 GB preferred)
- **Justification**: Your current system is using 6 GB for light development, and AI work or running multiple services would quickly exhaust 8 GB. 32 GB ensures smooth multitasking and running larger AI models locally if needed.

### 2. CPU
- **Current**: Intel Core i5-12400 (6C/12T)
- **Recommendation**: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7700X
- **Justification**: 12th Gen i5 is capable, but upgrading to an 8C/16T or 12C/24T CPU will significantly improve compilation times and AI inference speeds if you start running models locally.

### 3. Storage
- **Recommendation**: 1 TB NVMe SSD (2 TB preferred)
- **Justification**: Projects with large datasets or many node modules benefit from fast NVMe storage. 2 TB allows for multiple project clones and large datasets.

### 4. GPU
- **Recommendation**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 12 GB or RTX 4060 16 GB (or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT)
- **Justification**: For local AI work or GPU-accelerated development. Even for cloud-based AI, a mid-range GPU can help with local pre-processing or testing small models.

### 5. Motherboard
- **Recommendation**: DDR4 or DDR5 based on CPU choice
- **Justification**: Ensure compatibility with your chosen CPU and RAM. DDR5 motherboards offer future-proofing but are currently more expensive.

### 6. Power Supply
- **Recommendation**: 650-750W 80+ Gold certified
- **Justification**: Provides sufficient power for all components and some overclocking headroom.

### Complete Build Suggestions:

#### Mid-Range Build (Excellent Value):
- **CPU**: Intel Core i7-13700K (16C/24T)
- **RAM**: 32 GB DDR5 6000 MHz
- **Storage**: 2 TB NVMe SSD
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4060 16 GB
- **Motherboard**: Z790 DDR5
- **Power Supply**: 750W 80+ Gold
- **Case**: ATX with good airflow

#### Budget-Friendly Build:
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X (8C/16T)
- **RAM**: 16 GB DDR5 5600 MHz
- **Storage**: 1 TB NVMe SSD
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 12 GB
- **Motherboard**: B650 DDR5
- **Power Supply**: 650W 80+ Gold
- **Case**: Micro ATX with good airflow

## Benefits:
- **Faster Compilation**: Multiple cores and high clock speeds reduce build times
- **Smooth Multitasking**: 32 GB RAM allows running backend, frontend, and IDE simultaneously
- **AI Work**: GPU acceleration for local testing of small AI models
- **Future-Proofing**: DDR5, PCIe 4.0, and modern CPU architectures will serve you well for several years

## Timeline for Upgrade:
If your current system is struggling with:
1. Slow compilation times
2. Frequent lag or freezing when running multiple services
3. Out of memory errors
It's time to upgrade. Otherwise, your current system should suffice for at least another year.
